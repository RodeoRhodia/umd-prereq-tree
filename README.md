## How To Use

<br>
Try out the app: https://umd-prereq-tree.vercel.app/ 

## Key Features
* Developed a front-end app that collects all the prerequisites of a given course at University of Maryland.
* UMD course data is fetched from UMD.io's open API.
* The courses and prerequisites are then displayed as a flowchart.
* In the prerequisite tree, you can click on a course for more details.

## Improvements in Future
* Expand Prerequisite Tree if a course has many options for a prerequisite.
